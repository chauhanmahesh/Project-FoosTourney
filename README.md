# FoosTourney

This project is part of Udacity's 'iOS Nanodegree Programme' final submission.

## Introduction:

'FoosTourney' is a iOS mobile app meant for Foosball players to easily organize a tournament within organization/group and to keep a record of matches, teams and score.

Many times in organization like ours we have many individuals who are interested in foodball and want to organize a tournament within a company. And always the hard part in doing that is choose someone who will bear all the headache of choosing random teams and tracking matches in a speadsheet and scores and eventaully deciding the winner based on points standings.
This app will basically totally removes that neccessity of that individual and it does all that by itself and any player can basically create the tournament.

All the scores and list of matches and what is the current standings and winner is right below your tips.

## Features:

### Authentication:

### Groups:

- Can create multiple groups within organization or among different friends.
- Let's you choose a group for which you want to create a tournament.

### Tournaments:

- Can create 'Singles' or 'Doubles' tournaments.
- Select any number of players. (For doubles it has to even so that proper teams can be generated.)
- Fancy team names generated randomly for each team (in doubles) so that you don't have to think hard to choose a team name.
- Randomly generates the teams so you don't have to draw the chits and don't have to worry about biased team selection. All is random.

### Fancy Stats:

- Shows standings for each tournament and shows who is running as winner as per the points.

### Tournament Dashboard

- Tapping on a particular tournament will lead you to Tournament Dashboard where you can see a list of matches and a standings table.
  If the match is already scored then it will show a score against a team or a player (singles). If match is not scored yet then tapping on row will lead to "Record Score" page where you can record the score of a match.

  If the match is already score then it shows trophy symbol (üèÜ) in front of the winner team or player (Singles)

  Note: The points given to a team/player when they won a match is based on this formula:

  (2 points for a win) + (Goals difference)

  So if player/team won a game with score 10 -> 2 then they will get (2 + 8) = 10 points.
